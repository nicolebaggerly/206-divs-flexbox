            <header>Hi, I'm Nicole.</header>
            <main>I am a Front End & Responsive Web Developer. I started my career in tech with Skillcrush, taking their Break Into Tech course. The course was super beneficial in teaching the basics, not to mention in a fun and easy-to-understand way. On top of that, the Skillcrush community has been a great resource to have now and in the future.

                To most, I seem like a world traveler; but in my mind, I'm just trying to find where it feels like "home". But maybe this is not a specific city or an actual place with a name. 
            </div>
            <div class="div-2">
                One of my favorite parts of traveling is learning about different cultures and people's way of life. The foods they eat, clothes they wear, how they carry themselves, and how they interact with their surroundings. 
            </div>
            <div class="div-3">
                I once read advice about finding yourself. It said, "Take yourself on a date. What are your answers to questions you would normally ask someone on a first date?" So maybe this time, instead of absorbing from the outside, I embody what's already inside.
